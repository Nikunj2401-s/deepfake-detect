# 🧠 DeepFake Detect  
### *AI-Powered Media Authenticity Analyzer*  



---

## 🪶 Overview  
**DeepFake Detect** is a modern **AI-powered media verification tool** built with **React (Vite)** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It enables users to upload images or videos and analyze them for **signs of manipulation, deepfake generation, or metadata tampering** using simulated machine learning metrics.  

This project demonstrates how real-world deepfake detection platforms might visualize authenticity data using a clean, futuristic UI.

## ✨ Features  

✅ **Drag & Drop Upload**  
Easily upload or drag files (JPG, PNG, MP4, MOV) with instant previews.  

✅ **Simulated Deepfake Analysis**  
AI-mimic module generates realistic authenticity scores and anomaly flags.  

✅ **Detailed Analysis Report**  
Shows metadata forensics, audio-visual sync issues, and anomaly descriptions.  

✅ **History Tracking**  
Stores previous analyses for reference and comparison.  

✅ **Responsive & Interactive Design**  
Crafted with Tailwind CSS for a sleek, adaptive interface.

🌈 Future Enhancements

Integrate real ML models (e.g., DeepFace, MediaPipe, OpenCV) for live detection.

Add cloud upload API for larger videos.

Blockchain-backed verification reports for journalists and investigators.

Role-based dashboards for researchers and media houses.

🧠 Project Purpose

“Empowering digital integrity through AI-driven media verification.”

DeepFake Detect aims to raise awareness about deepfakes and misinformation by showing how AI tools can help ensure media authenticity in a visually engaging and educational way.
